    <?= HTML::print_page_header("How you can support " . SITE_NAME); ?>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in supporting <?= SITE_NAME; ?>! It's both
      humbling and encouraging to hear that you're interested in contributing
      to the work we're doing. I believe that what we're doing here at
      <?= SITE_NAME; ?> is vitally important, and it inspires me when people
      who've used <?= SITE_NAME; ?> want to support it as well.</p>

    <p>So how, specifically, can you support <?= SITE_NAME; ?>? To answer the
      most common question, <?= SITE_NAME; ?> accepts donations. However, there
      are also several other ways you can meaningfully support the ongoing
      maintenance and growth of <?= SITE_NAME; ?>'s ministry.</p>

    <p>The most direct way you can financially support <?= SITE_NAME; ?> is to
      become a member of <?= SITE_NAME; ?> Plus, our service that offers you
      more than 40 valuable Bible study resources in a banner ad-free
      environment. Included in the membership are some of the most popular
      study Bibles in the world. Experience <?= SITE_NAME; ?> Plus for yourself
      with a 30-day free trial.</p>

    <p>Another way to support <?= SITE_NAME; ?> is to make your Christian
      product purchases through the <?= SITE_NAME; ?> Store, which has an
      enormous selection of over 500,000 resources of Bibles, books, music, and
      more at excellent value with strong customer service and everyday discount
      savings. And all purchases made there support our ongoing work. Our Bible
      Gateway Deals program highlights a special deal from the store each
      week-you can sign up to have those deals emailed to you here.</p>

    <p><?= SITE_NAME; ?> is also supported by advertising, which means that
      another way you can support us is by taking note of ads on
      <?= SITE_NAME; ?> (or in our email newsletters) that interest you. We
      also send periodic offers from our advertising partners to our Partner
      Offers email list; we encourage you to sign up for that list and support
      our sponsors—which in turn supports <?= SITE_NAME; ?>.</p>

    <p>If you or your organization is interested in becoming an advertising
      sponsor on <?= SITE_NAME; ?>, please contact us for more information.</p>

    <p>Beyond these avenues of financial support, another way to show your
      support of <?= SITE_NAME; ?> is to simply let your friends know about us!
      Look us up on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+; tell your friends about the
      <?= SITE_NAME; ?> mobile App; share Bible verses from <?= SITE_NAME; ?>
      on your favorite social network—anything you can do to spread the word
      about our work and ministry is welcome.</p>

    <p>And last, but certainly not least, we always welcome your prayers as we
      work to make God's Word available to the world in as many translations,
      versions, and mediums as possible. Knowing that we're in the thoughts and
      prayers of people like you around the world is greatly encouraging to me
      and the entire <?= SITE_NAME; ?> team.</p>

    <p>Thanks again for your interest in supporting <?= SITE_NAME; ?>, and if
      you have questions about any of these, don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

    <p><br>Sincerely,<br><br>
      Andrew Masiye<br>
      Lead Developer, <?= SITE_NAME; ?></p>
